Agenda item 1
Demonstration Feedback:
Client was quite happy by the demonstration given and the suggestions given by us. Still there was some of the things that client suggested for the development of the application and they are: 
1.	The items in the homepage should be made accordingly as Credit Transfer Info, Eligibility for Credit Transfer, Request Credit Transfer and then the Live Chat box. 
2.	Some of the Names of the item should be changed i.e. Eligibility for credit transfer instead of Apply for Credit Check.
3.	There should be included icons as per the description.
4.	ATMC account should be linked with the credit transfer application in order to sign up.
5.	There should be notification given to the Credit Transfer staff as per the application submitted in the application.
Agenda item 2: 
Client suggested that the next highest priority is to be able to add products to the database so that they can know how many students have applied for the credit transfer process. 
We suggested that we need to discuss about the functions for the application. We will be discussing about all the Eligibility criteria for the credit transfer and information to be provided in the application for the credit transfer.
